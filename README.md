fedora-puppet
=============

A set of puppet modules and other files for standing up an instance of fedora4. Mostly targeted for deployment on AWS EC2, but you could probably use it on something else. Assumes you will clone directly to your box's /etc/puppet folder, and makes a ton of other assumptions (only tested with Ubuntu "Trusty" 14.4, though most any flavor of Debian ought to work... RHEL/CentOS... wow, good luck).

BTW, this is a total work in progress. Use at your own risk.
